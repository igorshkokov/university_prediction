# university_ranking_prediction

A very little machine learning project with a goal to predict female/male ratio in top 1000 world universities. Pandas, pyCaret, Exploratory software.

# What's in it:
- raw .csv file with data from https://www.timeshighereducation.com/, formatted by Kaggle
- an .ipynb file used in my presentation 

# Conclusions:
- Machine learning models can predict up to 60% in female/male ratio, with the most influence coming from number of students in university, and least influence coming from level of research in it
- Nice clustering of universities can be made, separating them to 3 big groups:
  - Very big universities, mostly from developing countries like Brazil, Egypt, Turkey
  - Research-driven universities with USA private ones at the top
  - International universities, mostly from UK or Switzerland
